## Intro

Aviation connects people and goods in almost every corner of the world.

Today's global connectedness has a profound impact on economic and cultural growth. Airports are the main instruments through which this global connectedness takes shape.

The world's busiest airport is HartsfieldJackson Atlanta International Airport in the United States. More than 88 million passengers traveled through ATL in 2009 alone, with aircrafts taking-off or landing every 37 seconds.
